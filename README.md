# Querying-a-Restful-API
Developing a currency converter using a Currency Restful service. 
This application utilizes python to query a RESTFUL API. The resulting application is a currency converter

#Test file
The testcurrency.py file is a unit test script that contains several procedures that test all the functions in the currency module. This file imports introcs and currency modules.

#Currency
The currency.py file provides string parsing functions that process the results from querying an online currency service. The functions use assert statements to enforce preconditions for parameters. https://github.com/DominiqueBlair/Querying-a-Restful-API/blob/main/currency.py

#Exchange
The exchangeit.py module is a script that when ran, prompts the user to enter an original currency, money amount and then new currency to convert to. The user's input is then passed into the exchange function from the currency module and the returned value is saved in a python object.
